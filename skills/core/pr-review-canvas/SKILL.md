# 🗺️ Skill: pr-review-canvas

## Purpose
Turn an unstructured diff into a structured review map: what changed, why it matters, where to look first, and what to be careful about. Helps reviewers focus attention rather than read everything.

## Trigger phrases
- "review canvas"
- "map this PR"
- "pr-review-canvas"
- "give me a PR overview"
- "structure this PR for review"

## Steps

### 1. Fetch the diff
```bash
# If PR number is known:
gh pr diff <number>

# If on the branch:
git diff main...HEAD --stat
git diff main...HEAD
```

Also fetch the PR description:
```bash
gh pr view <number>
```

### 2. Categorize every changed file
Assign each file to one category:

| Category | What it means |
|----------|---------------|
| **Feature** | New user-visible behaviour |
| **Fix** | Bug correction |
| **Refactor** | Structure change, no behaviour change |
| **Config** | Environment, build, or tooling config |
| **Test** | Test-only changes |
| **Infra** | CI, Docker, deployment |
| **Docs** | Documentation or comments only |

### 3. Build the reviewer map

```
## PR Canvas: <PR title>

### Summary
<2-3 sentences: what this PR does and why>

### Change map
| File / Area | Category | Lines ±  | Risk | Reviewer note |
|-------------|----------|----------|------|---------------|
| src/foo.ts  | Feature  | +120/-30 | Med  | Core logic change — review carefully |
| tests/foo.test.ts | Test | +80 | Low | Covers happy path + 2 edge cases |
| config/env.example | Config | +3 | Low | New env var — check deployment runbook |

### Risk sections (read these first)
1. <file>:<line-range> — <reason it's risky>
2. ...

### What's NOT in this PR (but might be expected)
- <missing tests for X>
- <no migration for schema change>
- ...

### Suggested review order
1. <file or area to read first>
2. ...
```

### 4. Flag concerns
Automatically flag:
- Files changed without accompanying tests (for non-trivial logic).
- Config changes with no documentation update.
- Large single files (>300 lines changed) — suggest splitting if not already merged.
- Direct changes to `main`/`master` branch protection files.
- Secrets-adjacent files (`.env`, credential configs).

### 5. Output
Print the reviewer map to chat. If the user asks, also write it as `PR_CANVAS.md` in the repo root (gitignored by default).

## Output
Structured reviewer map with change categorization, risk flags, and suggested review order.
