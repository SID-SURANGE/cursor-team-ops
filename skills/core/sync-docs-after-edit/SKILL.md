# 📝 Skill: sync-docs-after-edit

## Purpose
Keep documentation honest after local edits or commits. Distinct from `sync-docs-after-git-pull` (which fires after receiving remote changes) — this skill reacts to **what you just changed locally**.

## Trigger phrases
- "sync docs"
- "check if docs are up to date"
- "update docs after my changes"
- "did my change break any docs?"
- "sync-docs-after-edit"

## Steps

### 1. Identify what changed
```bash
# Uncommitted changes
git diff --name-only

# Last commit
git diff --name-only HEAD~1..HEAD

# Staged but not committed
git diff --cached --name-only
```

Collect the full set of changed source files. Exclude `.md` files themselves from the "changed source" list — they are the targets, not the triggers.

### 2. Discover all documentation files
```bash
# Find all markdown files, excluding node_modules, .git, vendor, etc.
find . -name "*.md" \
  -not -path "*/.git/*" \
  -not -path "*/node_modules/*" \
  -not -path "*/vendor/*" \
  -not -path "*/.venv/*"
```

### 3. For each .md file, assess relevance

Read the `.md` file and the changed source files. Assess:

| Question | If yes → |
|----------|----------|
| Does the doc reference a function, class, or API that was renamed or removed? | **Needs update** |
| Does the doc describe a workflow or command that no longer works as written? | **Needs update** |
| Does the doc include example code that is now incorrect? | **Needs update** |
| Does the doc describe a config option that was added or changed? | **Needs update** |
| Is the doc entirely unrelated to the changed files? | **Not affected** |
| Is the doc correct and consistent with the changes? | **Up to date** |

### 4. Report per-file verdicts

Always include `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` as explicit rows — even if they appear unaffected. These are the two docs most likely to drift silently.

```
Documentation sync report
Changed source files: <list>

| Doc file | Verdict | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| README.md | Needs update | Quick Start references `DB_URL` — now `DATABASE_URL` |
| CHANGELOG.md | Needs entry | No entry yet for changes in this diff |
| docs/api.md | Needs update | References `getUser()` which was renamed to `fetchUser()` |
| docs/setup.md | Up to date | |
```

### 5. Apply updates (if instructed)
If the user says "update them" or "fix the docs":
- For each file marked **Needs update**: make the minimal edit to bring it in line with the code changes.
- Do not rewrite docs wholesale — only fix what's factually stale.
- After editing, re-run the assessment for the updated files to confirm they're now clean.

### 6. Final confirmation
After all updates:
```
All docs synced.
Updated: <list of files changed>
No-change: <list confirmed up to date>
```

## Output
A per-file verdict table, plus optional edits if the user confirms.

## Notes
- If `CHANGELOG.md` exists, always flag it as a candidate — new changes often warrant a changelog entry.
- If `README.md` has a "Quick start" or "API" section, always read it against the changed source.
- Do not update `CHANGELOG.md` automatically — propose the entry and let the user confirm.
