# Skill: workflow-from-chats

## Purpose
Turn a repeated or valuable conversation pattern into a reusable, committable `SKILL.md` so the team never has to re-explain the same workflow.

## Steps

### 1. Identify the pattern
- Review the recent conversation (or the user-selected excerpt).
- Look for:
  - A multi-step workflow the user walked the agent through manually.
  - A prompt the user re-typed with minor variations.
  - A sequence of tool calls that produced a consistently useful outcome.
- If ambiguous, ask: "Which part of this conversation should become the skill?"

### 2. Name and classify
- Choose a short kebab-case name (e.g. `fix-slow-query`, `generate-migration`).
- Pick a trigger phrase that would naturally recall this skill in future sessions.
- Identify the skill's scope: does it belong in the team kit (`~/.cursor/skills/`) or the current project (`.cursor/skills/`)?

### 3. Draft the SKILL.md
Produce a file with this structure:

```markdown
---
name: <kebab-case-name>
description: <One sentence. Include the trigger phrases.>
---

# Skill: <name>

## Purpose
<Why this skill exists — the pain it avoids.>

## Trigger phrases
- "<phrase 1>"
- "<phrase 2>"

## Steps
<Numbered steps extracted from the conversation. Be prescriptive, not descriptive.>

## Output
<What the skill produces — files created, commands run, verdicts returned.>

## Example
<Optional: a minimal before/after or sample invocation.>
```

### 4. Validate before writing
- Confirm the steps are reproducible without the original conversation context.
- Remove any project-specific details if the skill targets `~/.cursor/skills/`.
- Ensure trigger phrases are distinct from existing skills.

### 5. Write and report
- Write the file to the correct location.
- Report: skill name, file path, trigger phrases, and one-line description.

## Output
A single `SKILL.md` ready to commit.
