# Skill: architecture-decision-records

## Purpose
Capture significant architectural or design decisions in a lightweight, durable format. Prevents "why did we do it this way?" from being answered by archaeology. Useful for code repos, requirements repos, and consulting deliverables alike.

## Trigger phrases
- "create an ADR"
- "document this decision"
- "architecture-decision-records"
- "write an ADR for this"
- "record this design decision"
- "ADR"

## Steps

### 1. Determine the ADR directory
- Check if `docs/adr/`, `adr/`, or `decisions/` exists in the repo.
- If none exists, default to `docs/adr/` and create it.
- Check `.cursor/` or `AGENTS.md` for a project-specific ADR path override.

### 2. Assign a number
```bash
ls docs/adr/ | sort | tail -1
```
Next ADR number = last number + 1. Zero-pad to 4 digits: `0001`, `0002`, etc.

### 3. Determine the status
Choose one:
- **Proposed** — under discussion, not yet accepted.
- **Accepted** — the decision has been made and is in effect.
- **Deprecated** — was accepted but is no longer relevant.
- **Superseded by ADR-XXXX** — replaced by a newer decision.

### 4. Draft the ADR

Filename: `docs/adr/<NNNN>-<kebab-case-title>.md`

```markdown
# ADR-<NNNN>: <Title>

**Date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>  
**Status:** <Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded by ADR-XXXX>  
**Deciders:** <names or roles>

---

## Context

<What is the situation or problem that motivated this decision? Include constraints, forces, and relevant background. Be factual — no advocacy here.>

## Decision

<What was decided? State it clearly and directly. "We will use X" not "We should consider X".>

## Rationale

<Why was this option chosen over the alternatives? List the alternatives considered and why they were rejected.>

| Option | Pro | Con | Chosen? |
|--------|-----|-----|---------|
| <A>    | ... | ... | Yes |
| <B>    | ... | ... | No — reason |

## Consequences

### Positive
- <benefit 1>
- <benefit 2>

### Negative / Trade-offs
- <cost 1>
- <risk 1>

### Neutral
- <change in process or tooling that is neither good nor bad>

## References
- <link to relevant issue, PR, document, or external resource>
```

### 5. Link from index (if exists)
If `docs/adr/README.md` or `docs/adr/index.md` exists, append the new ADR to its table:

```markdown
| ADR | Title | Status | Date |
|-----|-------|--------|------|
| [ADR-NNNN](NNNN-title.md) | <title> | Accepted | YYYY-MM-DD |
```

If no index exists and this is the second or later ADR, create one.

### 6. Report
```
ADR created: docs/adr/<NNNN>-<title>.md
Status: <status>
Index updated: yes / no
```

## Guardrails
- An ADR records the decision as made — do not sanitize or omit the real trade-offs.
- Do not create an ADR for trivial choices (variable naming, minor config). Reserve for decisions that affect system structure, team workflow, or are hard to reverse.
- If the decision has already been partially implemented, note that in the **Context** section.
- If superseding an older ADR, update the older ADR's status to "Superseded by ADR-NNNN".
